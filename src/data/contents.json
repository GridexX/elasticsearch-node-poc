It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google. But they launched it in 2009 as an open-source programming language. It provides a rich standard library, garbage collection, and dynamic-typing capability and also provides support for the environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic languages. The latest version of the Golang is 1.13.1 released on 3rd September 2019. Here, we are providing a complete tutorial of Golang with proper examples."
